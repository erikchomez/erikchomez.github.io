      I am a software developer with a passion for developing scalable and robust systems. I have a background in computer science with a focus in machine learning, and I have a strong interest in the intersection of technology and art. I am currently working as a software developer at [VMware](https://vmware.com) in Palo Alto, CA. 

      I recently finished working on a project to optimize our internal resource lock manager, and will begin working on a new initiative to add workflows for adding, applying, and managing custom ISOs.

          - Maintained and supported VCF, a distributed Java application with over 1 million lines of code, using Maven, PostgreSQL, and Spring
          - Designed and implemented Jenkins CI pipelines to automate integration testing. Achieved an 80% increase in productivity and efficiency by streamlining the integration testing process through automation.
          - Leveraged JProfiler and JMC to identify high memory and CPU usage workflows in scale environments. Implemented a redesigned frugal locking algorithm resulting in up to a 95% reduction in overhead.
